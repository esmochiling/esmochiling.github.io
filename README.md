### Development

Taking for granted you have installed [node](http://nodejs.org) and you are using one of the latest versions.

```bash
> yarn
> yarn dev
```

### Staging
If you want to test your changes in a staging server, you will need to:

- Create a pull request.
- In that PR, make a comment saying: `deploy staging`.
- Probot-empty will deploy it to staging :).
- Changes will appear at [mochiling-staging.now.sh](https://mochiling-staging.now.sh).

### Production

Any branch merged into `master` branch will trigger a production build thanks to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). Results will be visible at [mochiling.es](https://mochiling.es).

## Database (*)

We only use a "database" for storing members or experiences. It has been created with Firestore (a Firebase product, bought by Google) and it is located [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/mochiling-production/database), if you need any access, talk with [xavijam](mailto:xavijam@gmail.com).
