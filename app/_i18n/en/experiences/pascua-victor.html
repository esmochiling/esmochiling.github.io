<p>"Eyes peer from three storied giants
ancient stone men, Moais

look at how the tourists gawk,
cameras clicking
beaches at Anakena and Ovake
enjoy the laughter,
white sands.

Not since the Long Ears and Short Ears
battled at Poike Ditch in 1680
has there been so much
energy wasted.

Be careful,
Orongo is sleeping
for now."" 
Richard Provencher</p>
