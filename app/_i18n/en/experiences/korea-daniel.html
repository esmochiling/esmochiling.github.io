<p>I'm pretty proud of this one, like I'm proud of my 10 years in this country. Growing up in South Korea, that's what this is about. I hope all PNU historians, past, present and future appreciate this. I'm happy to hear these videos are inducing a ton of nostalgia. In making this album, I thought often of how Korea changed me and, if and when I do leave, I'm happy I'll have this to remember Korea by. Enjoy!</p>
