My wife and I went to Puerto Princessa, anticipating falling in love with El Nido, as most travelers do. El Nido was impressive, but, in the truest Mochilling way, we discovered a hidden gem and left our hearts in Port Barton. Each night, the electricity is turned off at 7 to save power and you're treated to a sky full of stars and the smells of chicken sticks. There are basketball games down each little dirt road and the people are just so happy to have you. Port Barton, get it while it's paradise!
