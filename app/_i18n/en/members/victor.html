<p>Since i was a kid, my parents build up some wings, that take me to my passion on knowing as much places as possible in a different way, and try to think on a wide, open and tolerant way.</p>
<p>Life is one and really short, and the world its full of experiences to live.</p>
<p>That the reason why I've started this project, that we hope to be able to help people to <span class="Color--emphasis">live their trips</span> on a different and authentic way.</p>
